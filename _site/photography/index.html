                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">Go Cloud Based is an Ottawa start up company, which transfers businesses into the cloud. The look and feel for the brand was to be modern and clean. The icon designed is a simple cloud along with a line vanishing up into the cloud.  The typography is a simple sans-serif font contrasted with different weights and colours. The colours chosen were shades of sleek and modern blues, and grays.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">EPIC <em>(Employee Policy Innovation Committee)</em> is a committee within Employment and Social Development Canada. They wanted a graphic created to represent their committee. They support innovation and ideas brought forth by numerous employees. The design created represents collaboration and brainstorming. It is an energetic and fun representation of employees contributing their ideas in a dynamic and evolving way. The font is bold, yet complimentary to the graphic. The colours were chosen because they are bright and energetic, and really represent the committee.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was a school assignment in which we had to choose a local company to rebrand. I chose a hair studio targeted towards women, with an open concept and modern vibe. The design created is a minimal graphic image of hair. The swirls represent the loose curls of long beautiful hair. I kept the design simple and clean to match the modern feel of the salon. Choosing colours I kept the interior of Pure Hair Design in mind, as well as the targeted audience. I wanted something feminine but not overwhelming so it wouldn’t turn off men. The typography chosen is a modern serif font. Pure Hair was kept large and set in all capitals to stand out. The design part of the typography was set smaller, below, and in italic to contrast with the main focus. A simply thin line was used to balance the piece and add visual interest.</p>

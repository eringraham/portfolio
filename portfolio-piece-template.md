Title: Izze Ad Campaign
Date: September 2014
Category: Advertisment 
Description: IZZE is an all-natural healthy soda, made with real fruit juice and sparkling water. The goal was to create a cohesive ad campaign that that appeals to their young adult target audience. My concept was to reach out to the audience by getting involved through social media. The tagline ‘Better your selfiie’ encourages consumers to get involved and take photos of themselves with
the IZZE beverage. Each campaign piece showcases a young adult better themselves naturally with the drink. This project began with a concept, I then sketched out different layouts and played around with colour to match each drink. I created the project using photography, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign.

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was to create a company that sells software as a service. The requirements were to design and code a responsive website for the
created company. The company I created named View sells blogging and website building software. The service allows you to purchase themes to create your own online website or blog. After extensive UI research I created my final design. It is modern with large images, and clean graphics and typography. The colours were chosen to appeal to the target audience, and the images were adjusted to match the scheme. I created this multipage responsive website using HTML and CSS.

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">The project was to redesign a website for a small local restaurant. The final design needed to represent the restaurant, and be responsive for all devices. I chose a small local bistro located in Manotick. The restaurant has a rustic feel, with warm wood tones and a relaxing upscale atmosphere. My redesign compliments the interior of the Bistro. I kept the design clean, polished, and easy to navigate through. The warm colour tones were pulled from the restaurant itself, giving off a rustic and inviting feel.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was a school assignment in which we had to choose a local company to rebrand. I chose a hair studio targeted towards women, with an open concept and modern vibe. The design created is a minimal graphic image of hair. The swirls represent the loose curls of long beautiful hair. I kept the design simple and clean to match the modern feel of the salon. Choosing colours I kept the interior of Pure Hair Design in mind, as well as the targeted audience. I wanted something feminine but not overwhelming so it wouldnâ€™t turn off men. The typography chosen is a modern serif font. Pure Hair was kept large and set in all capitals to stand out. The design part of the typography was set smaller, below, and in italic to contrast with the main focus. A simply thin line was used to balance the piece and add visual interest.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was to create a company that sells software as a service. The requirements were to design and code a responsive website for the
created company. The company I created named View sells blogging and website building software. The service allows you to purchase themes to create your own online website or blog. After extensive UI research I created my final design. It is modern with large images, and clean graphics and typography. The colours were chosen to appeal to the target audience, and the images were adjusted to match the scheme. I created this multipage responsive website using HTML and CSS.

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">The project was to redesign a website for a small local restaurant. The final design needed to represent the restaurant, and be responsive for all devices. I chose a small local bistro located in Manotick. The restaurant has a rustic feel, with warm wood tones and a relaxing upscale atmosphere. My redesign compliments the interior of the Bistro. I kept the design clean, polished, and easy to navigate through. The warm colour tones were pulled from the restaurant itself, giving off a rustic and inviting feel.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">Sprout is an app created to help out any gardener. The app allows you to take a photo of a budding plant so you can find out exactly what it is. The idea is that it will make weeding your garden less frustrating, so you accidentally donâ€™t weed your favourite plant. The app opens into camera mode and once a photo is taken it will bring you to a description page about what the plant is and how to care for it or remove it. Other features in the app include and extensive library of plants, and a section to save your favourites. The design was kept modern; I wanted to used greens and blues but keep it fresh and appealing to all users. </p>

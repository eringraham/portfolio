                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was to recreate a movie poster. I chose a classic movie, and decided to create a poster with a bit of a twist. I wanted the poster to represent the movie well, yet stand out from what you would normally picture in your mind. I chose to use the iconic rose from Beauty and the Beast, and have it feel magical. The poster was created using Adobe Photoshop and Indesign.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">Winning poster design for the Algonquin College Theatre department. The college held a contest to design a poster for their upcoming play titled 7 Stories. The client described her vision for the poster, and the basis of the play. To create this poster I began sketching out different concepts. After deciding which concept to go with, I then scanned my artwork to the computer. The final piece was created in Adobe Illustrator using the pen tool and shapes. The typography for the title was chosen to match the quirkiness of the play, and the additional information was set in a complimentary font that is easily legible.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">IZZE is an all-natural healthy soda, made
with real fruit juice and sparkling water. The goal was to create a cohesive ad campaign that that appeals to their young adult target audience. My concept was to reach out to the audience by getting involved through social media. The tagline ‘Better your selfiie’ encourages consumers to get involved
and take photos of themselves with the IZZE beverage. Each campaign piece showcases a young adult better themselves naturally with the drink.
                    This project began with a concept, I then sketched out different layouts and played around with colour to match each drink. I created the project using photography, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign.</p>

            <p class="about pad-b">Hi, I’m Erin Graham and I am a Graphic Designer located in Ottawa, Canada. I am currently in my final year of design school set to graduate April 2016. I have a creative mind, and a genuine love for anything design. My style is strong, clean, and adaptive to take on different projects. I believe that less is more, and I pay close attention to detail.</p>
